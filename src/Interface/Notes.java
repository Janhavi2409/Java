/*------------------------------------------INTERFACE--------------------------------------------------------
* ->interface consists by default abstract and public methods
* ->interface has by default static, public and final
* ->by using interface we can by default achieve 100% abstraction
* -> class to interface relation is given by IMPLEMENTS keyword instead of EXTENDS keyword
* ->interface to interface relation is given by EXTENDS keyword
* ->class to class relation is also given by EXTENDS keyword
* ->interface represents is a relationship
* eg:-            <---is a----<student
*       Person<--|
*                 <---is a ---<employee
*->to achieve multiple inheritance we implement interface
* eg:- class HDFC implements Bank, Bank Operations{
* }
* ->we cannot instantiate
* ->achieve loose coupling
* ->there is no need to write abstract or public before any variable or else error is shown
* eg:-abstract double Vehicle;*/
